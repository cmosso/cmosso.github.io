# Biosketch
I am a Duke PROSPER T32 Postdoctoral Fellow in Jichun Xie's lab [(lab website)](https://jichunxie.github.io/index.html) 
at Duke University. My general research interests include latent variable models, 
association mining, manifold and graph learning, statistical methods for 
common and rare variant analysis, single-cell multi-omics methods, 
and applications of deep neural networks such as GNNs.

## Current Research Focus
I am currently focused on common and rare variant analysis of human genetics data to study Interstitial Lung Diesease (ILD). This research is supported by the Duke PROSPER T32 training grant [(program website)](https://medicine.duke.edu/education-and-training/fellowship-programs/pulmonary-allergy-and-critical-care-medicine/t32-program).
