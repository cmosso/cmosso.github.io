# Biosketch

I am a Duke PROSPER T32 Postdoctoral Fellow in Jichun Xie's lab at Duke 
University. My general research interests include latent variable models, 
association mining, manifold and graph learning, statistical methods for 
common and rare variant analysis, single-cell multi-omics methods, 
and applications of deep neural networks such as GNNs.

I am currently focused on common and rare variant analysis of human genetics data to study Interstitial Lung Diesease (ILD).
